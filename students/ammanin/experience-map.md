### Scenario
Lola gets back from a busy day of work, tired and drained. She's had a few nights of insomnia in a row and it's starting to have visible effects. She prepares a quick dinner for herself and skims through what's on her docket for the next day. She has an important meeting and needs her sleep but doesn't have the time or energy for her complete nighttime routine - which doesn't always work. She needs something, which at the touch of a button, will calm her and allow her to get a good night's sleep.

#### Main Flow

- Lola pushes a button and lies down in bed.
- Lola waves her hand on top of slumber.
- Soothing light turns on.
- Calming music starts to play.
- Therapeutic aroma is sprayed above the bed and is sprayed every five minutes till the user falls asleep.
- Once the user has fallen asleep, the music softens and stops playing.
- The light ebbs away.

#### Alternate Flow
- The user starts to move a lot but is still half asleep.
- The device senses the movement and sprays the aroma.
- The pillow starts to vibrate (massage the head) lightly to put the user back to deep REM sleep.
