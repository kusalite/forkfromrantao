# Sprint 1: MVP - Music and Aroma Actuation 

### Sprint Catalog

For the first sprint, I concentrated on actuating of the main features which are:
Aroma: This is accomplished using a humidifier.
Music: This uses a DFplayer and speaker.

### Sprint Review  

The sprint started with an attempt to actuate the DFplayer. There were a few conflicting resources for the code and the circuit. After some trial and error, the circuit was corrected and the code was understood. The next step was to actuate the humidifier. The code for this was very simple but the humidifiers needs to be taken apart and rewired. 

### End of Sprint Prototype

After going through 2 humidifier, the result of this sprint has been the actuation of the DFplayer and the humidifier. Unfortunately, the second humidifier also stopped working and will need to be replaced.

### Sprint Retrospective 

I am happy I accomplished both tasks and learned a lot from this sprint. The actuation of the music was easier to accomplish than expected (thanks to Elvin). The actuation of the aroma turned out to be more challenging. The rewiring required for the humidifier makes it unstable. The volume of the speaker was too low. During this sprint, I concentrated completely only on the actuation and understanding how the device would work.

### Next Steps

My next steps are:
* Find an alternative for the humidifier or rewire another one.
* Actuate the pulsing light
* Define the states and code the order of the actuations

For the next sprint I plan to connect the sensors to trigger the actuations
