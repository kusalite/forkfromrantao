### Proposal
The device will tackle night anxiety and insomnia by creating a soothing environment which promotes the user to fall asleep. Difficulty falling asleep is a problem many people face and can lead to a cycle of anxiety and insomnia - a person can not fall asleep because they're anxious about falling asleep. Through research and experimentation, I found a few elements in the sleep environment which can reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality. These elements will be incorporated in the device and automated to respond to various inputs such as movement of the individual and ambient light.

The projects is broken down into:
#### INPUT: Sleep tracking
 - Movement
 
#### OUTPUT: Sleep inducing / Reducing anxiety
 - Music
 - Smell
 - Light
