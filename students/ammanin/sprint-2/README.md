# Sprint 2: Adding Intelligence

### Sprint Catalog

The second sprint will involve connecting the sensors to the various actuations and handling the nuances of the various states. The sensors used are
- PIR sensor which will detect if a person is waiving their hand in front of the device.
- Ambient light sensor which will detect if the light is on.
- A accelerometer will detect if the person is awake depending on how much they're moving.

### Sprint Review  

By the end of the sprint, all the sensors were working and were used to activate the various states. The calibration of the various sensors and integration of the various actuators still needs fine tuning and is not optimized.  

### End of Sprint Prototype

The form of the prototype is still on paper but the circuits have been finalized to a great degree. The final device will be 3D printed and will have a egg-mushroom form. This will have an external power supply. The accelerometer sensor will be in a pillow and will be battery powered. 

### Sprint Retrospective 

The most important learning from this sprint was understanding how to formalize the data into something useable. With respect to the accelerometer, I didnâ€™t need the actual data but the rate of change. Another aspect was realising the spikes of changes I was looking at were minute and distinguishing when someone is awake and asleep would require me to sample data more often. 

### Next Steps

The first and second sprint tackled the functionality of the device. The next steps in the development of the device are:

- Calibrating the sensor information optimally.
- Designing the form of the device.
- Testing the device.
