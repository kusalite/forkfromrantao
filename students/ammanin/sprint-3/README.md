# Sprint 3: Connectivity

### Sprint Catalog

During this sprint, I plan to work in multiple directions.
1. Fine tune the code to move seamlessly through the states and react to the sensors and data as expected.
2. Calibrate the actuations to be more nuanced regarding the timing of the humidifier, the selection of the song and the colours of the lights.
3. Design and build a form to house the device. 


### Sprint Review  

At the end of the sprint, I managed to get pretty far in each direction but the device still require more work. 

### End of Sprint Prototype

At the end of the Sprint, I accomplished:
1. I changed the humidifier actuation from a retrofitted off the shelf humidifier to an arduino compatible atomizer. This allows for flexibility in the design and is more reliable. 
2. The external form of the device was designed and 3D printed.
3. The colours and type of light patter where refined.
4. The music element was added.
5. The sleep data trigger was also refined

### Sprint Retrospective 

During this sprint, I had a really hard time designing a form which would not fail when 3D printed. The incremental changes in the experience took a lot more time than I thought it should and still has a lot to be desired. 

### Next Steps

COMPLETE THE DEVICE! 
The following need to be completed:
1. Design and 3D print the housing for the various internal components
2. Install the humidifier internally.
3. Refine the colours and patterns of the lights. 
4. Refine the threshold of the accelerometer.
