# Research Sprint 1
## Behaviour / Product Research

The search was directed towardf finding information about soothing interactions for the various senses. The three technical or interaction inspirations found were:
- [ ] Sound: [DreamPad](https://dreampadsleep.com/): A pillow which plays music and is controlled through an app. There are many such pillows on the market.
- [ ] Smell: [Lumiere Oil Diffuser](http://getlumiere.com/language/en/ ) There are many like this in the market which also act as humidifiers. The device is controlled by a mobile app.
- [ ] Vision: Many products aim to put users to sleep using light but I found more useful information when I directed my research towards colour theory and behavioural responses to different wavelengths of light and found an interesting article in the [Harvard Health Publication](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) and another one that corroborates the findings [here](https://chriskresser.com/how-artificial-light-is-wrecking-your-sleep-and-what-to-do-about-it/).

### Summary 

For the first sprint research, I concentrated on finding information on what creates a calming environment for each of the senses. I also looked at projects and products which aimed to achieve the same and tried to pinpoint those I could combine or replicate. 
 
### Findings

- [ ] Most products have the speakers within the pillow itself but that would be cumbersome and put restraints on the pillow which might not be to the users preference. The speakers and mp3 player will be housed in the nitemate. The tutorial was provided to my by Daragh, our professor and can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh3c_fuP8oQ).
- [ ] Most oil diffusers require water and act as a humidifier. The [Oil Diffuser using Arduino](https://forum.mysensors.org/topic/3296/ultrasonic-essential-oil-diffuser): A box which diffuses oil without the need for water. This removed the need to continuously replace the water and does not increase the humidity in the atmosphere.
- [ ] Interestingly, though blue is widely known to be the calming colour, it is considered a bad choice for a night light as it suppresses the production of melatonin in the body, the major hormone that controls sleep and wake cycles. The appropriate colour is in the red spectrum and has a long wavelength. Through prototyping, I will arrive at the most appropriate colour.

 
### Relevance
 
On researching these areas,  I have a better idea of the do’s and don’t for each actuation. I’ve come to an understanding of what tasks I need to undertake and which are the lowest hanging fruit that I should tackle first.
