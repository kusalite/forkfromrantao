# Final Sprint

### Sprint Catalog

The focus of this sprint is on below two items:

#### The display

With the near completion of physical frabrication to produce a smoothly spining LED strip. The top priority is to gee a stable POV display by fine tune the variables: Number of refreshes (pixels) per revolution/ time interval between refreshes etc.

#### The data input

With the tuned display capability, the next step is to explore the data convertion path to convert a picture file into a displayable RGB (or #key) data array.

#### The connectivity

The last step anticipated for this sprint is to build connectivity to read Instagram API to get the geo location data. This is optional for the DEMO if time does not permit so.

PLACE HOLDER FOR VIDEOS

### Product Review  

A POV globe with full color (8bit) display is successfully built. This globe has 36(V) X 96(H) resolution with 20FPS refresh rate. The current application demoed is to diplay the place visited in the past (based on Instagram geo tag data) and change the color of maps according to the color theme of the repective photo.

### Product Retrospective 

Looking back to the original objective of ths project, the target to build the physical POV globe is achieved. Despite higher than expected rounds of trial and errors, the globe is working close to the capability of the hardware components.

On the other hand, the interactive functions and the data connections of the product need to be further developed. Currently this product is running with zero UI, with all the data preloaded into the memory. To allow the accesss of end user, software interface has to be added for user to link the data to the globe. Further down, physical interaction should be considered to expand the application.

### Future Work

1. UI and connectivity to data 
2. Improve the processor efficiency by inroduce external storage
3. Physical interface
4. Quieter motor to make it trully an ambient device
5. Split ring in correct spec to support long life
6. LED of tighter gap to increase resolution
