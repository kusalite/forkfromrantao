### Proposal

MyGlobe(TBC) is an ambient display designed for travel and photography enthusiastics. It is created to provide a physical media to "display" the photos from the past trips,to evocate the memories as well as to inspire and motivate the future trips. It take shape of a globe, and has ability to light up geographic locations and change the overall lighting tone in multiple scenarios below:

Scenarios 1:
Inspired by the [Scratch Map](http://www.scratchmap.org/), MyGlobe extracts gps data from exif data of the photos stored in the phone, summrised the user's journey and lights up the citys that the user have visited,all at the same time or in animated sequence. Addtional to the light spot of the location, the system may light-up the globe based on the color theme of the photos (ambient photo frame).

Scenarios 2:
The system extrats data from recommended [best places to visit of the year](http://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/best-places-to-travel-in-2017#intro), [best photography place of the season](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2017/01/22/the-worlds-best-destinations-for-travel-photography-in-2017/#68ec73e02a93) and the dream destination of the user, display the location with light spot and screen the color theme of the place.

Scenarios 3:
With user inputing travel plan, it displays the weather forcast of the destination, withlighting (and sound) effects. When user does not have a rencent travel plan, it displays local weather forcast.
