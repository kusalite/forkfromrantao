### Proposal
This project is to design a toddler-friendly IoT gardening toy for 8-15 years old kids to cultivate their interests in plants and related knowledge. Growing plant at home needs knowledge and skills which can be hard to be understood by young kids without appropriate instructions. This toy will idealy have the following functions:
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Notify the HP and moisture of the soil as well as the quantity of light through a visualized way
* Remote watering and light control function
* Different types of way to water the plant
* Setup automatic watering and light control based on the value of sensor
* Use webpage to receive notification, track status of the plant, interact with the toy, and get instructions
