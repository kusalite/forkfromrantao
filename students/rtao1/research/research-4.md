# Final Sprint
## Usability Findings

_Prompt: Complete a heuristic evaluation or cognitive jogthrough (a quick and dirty usability evaluation with a small number of users) and report on your findings._

### Summary

I tested my device with website with two people to get some feedback on how to improve my product. One person has experience in home gardening and another one is totally a rookie to it. I firstly explained my idea to them and let them play with the website and the controller to see if these devices do help them or not. They were able to use the website and understand the designed functions. They both gave me some really good suggestion to improve my final design.

### Findings

#### Things that worked

- DHT22 humidity and temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor, analog light sensor, and water pump. Liquid level sensor doesn't work but I have explained the function to them.
- Controller that can visualize the values of the sensors and control the water pump.
- Website that can see the values of the sensors, judge if the environment is good for the plant and introduce contextual knowledge to user.
 
#### What to improve

##### User-Experience
- The watering function can be automatic from the person without experience. (I further explained that I made it manual on purpose since it enhanced the interaction between user and plant.)
- Both of them asked what will happen after certain days such as 100 days or 200 days.
- Both of them asked about the difference between humidity and soil moisture. (should be clear by changing humidity to air humidity)

##### Technical - Device
- The water pump and its tube should be placed better.

##### Technical - Website
- Considering to add a diary function between plant and user.
- Adding an introduction of the device would be helpful and help user better understand it.

### Relevance

After discussing with the two testees about the feedback, I have improved the website by adding the diary function and a device introduction section. Besides, I also tried to make the prototype waterproof by using hot glue to seal the water tank part but it somehow still leaks. Also, in the future, I need to try to use php to make it compatible with database so that it can support with multiple plants.
