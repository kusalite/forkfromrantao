### Proposal

I've always been intrigued by technology's ability to improve the physical and mental wellness of humans. A proven way to bring balance is through yoga and meditation. Hence I intend to build a mindful yoga mat, that can understand a user's exercise and meditation routine and provide audio guidance.
The mat will have 2 modes: one for meditation and the other for yoga. In each mode, the mat can guide the user through a timed routine while understanding the user's stress levels.
Features:
1. Uses weight on mat to sense presence
2. Tracks duration and frequency of exercise
3. Visually indicates time of exercise session
4. Plays appropriate meditation music
5. Plays appropriate yoga guiding session
6. Provides soothing vibration for meditation
