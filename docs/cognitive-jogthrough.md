# Cognitive Jog Through

The Cognitive Walkthrough and Cognitive Jogthrough Methods briefly explained

### Overview

The Cognitive Jogthrough (CJ) and Cognitive Walkthough (CW) allow the evaluation and critique of the design and implementation of a system from the perspective of end users goals. While end users are not required they can be involved in the process. The process requires the identification of the typical users of the system as well as their core tasks and goals when using the system. The participants of the walkthough then present the system and evaluate it iterating through each of the steps of the user’s goals and possible decisions. The Cognitive Jogthrough is an accelerated version of the walkthrough, which also removes some of the rigour and places a greater emphasis on discussion of the design. The walkthough method is very similar to code walkthroughs, which developers often use. Additionally participants are not required to have overt knowledge of the system under consideration nor are they required to have extensive understanding of evaluation principles and techniques. While it does provide an extensive review and flexibility on the scope of the investigation, they can be extremely time consuming to conduct, particularly the cognitive walkthrough.


### Materials needed 

What’s needed in order to run the methods?

* 3+ people (there are four roles to be assigned some of these can be shared by participants.)
* Plenty of copies of the evaluation sheets
* A working prototype, screen sketches, wireframes or some form of mock up or completed system to evaluate.
* Note taking equipment – pens, paper, etc or tape recorder or video recorder.
* A quiet meeting room preferably with a projector or large screen to demo on.
* A spare hour or two.

### Useful Inputs

* Personas can be used to give an overview of the “typical” user of the system
* Scenarios can be used to guide the walkthrough and select appropriate actions
to walkthrough
* Task Analyses can be used to provide user goals as well as their relationships and alternative paths via the task analysis’s plan.

### Roles

Within a cognitive walkthrough or a cognitive Jogthrough participants accept one of four roles.

1. _The Moderator:_ Chairs the meeting; ensure the discussion stays focused and on track; promotes appropriate discussion where relevant; should be familiar with the process of the walkthough and the requirements. (Can also be an evaluator)
2. _The Presenter: _Should have good knowledge of the project and process flow of the system; should be able to provide a good overview of the system, its users and its goals; traverses paths and executes actions to demonstrate them to the evaluators.
3. _The Recorder:_ Takes notes during the meeting; ensures the evaluation for each goal under consideration is completely noted in the correct format e.g. evaluation sheet; if electronic equipment is being used monitors and adjusts as needed. (Can also be an evaluator)
4. _The Evaluator:_ reviews the actions taken; discusses, questions and critiques the design; answers the 4 golden questions/evaluation sheet;

### The 4 Golden Questions:

Wharton, et al. (1994) described 4 questions, which the evaluation of a users action should revolve around, and in essence these questions become the crux of the evaluation technique.

1. Will the user try to achieve the right effect?
2. Will the user notice that the correct action is available?
3. Will the user associate the correct action with the effect that the user is trying to achieve?
4. If the correct action is performed, will the user see that progress is being made toward the solution of the task?

### Process

The steps to take to successfully complete a Cognitive Walkthough / JogThrough

#### Preparation & Task Selection

Carry out this stage independently prior to the main group meeting.

1. First, identify and evaluate the core tasks of the users of the system – this can be based on market experience, research gathered, task analysis or personas and scenarios you have prepared.
2. From these core tasks, identify the ones which are relatively simple, very complex and with high cognitive overhead.
3. Based on this prioritise the subset of tasks to be covered within the sitting of the evaluation and set a time constraint for the evaluation (typically about 1.5 hours.)

__Note:__ If this is the first evaluation of the group, it is recommended you select simple tasks to begin with. This will allow the group to become familiar with the technique.

#### Evaluation

1. During the evaluation the group will convene in a meeting room. It is important that everyone is aware of their role and the procedure of the evaluation. It is up to the Moderation to explain this.
2. The presenter should next quickly overview the users under consideration and the goals of the application i.e. what is does.
3. The presenter will then present drawings, sketches or prototypes of the proposed behaviour of the system.
4. The presenter will describe the task to be evaluated, and the preferred path to the goal state.
5. During the walkthrough the presenter will follow the preferred path, execute all the actions required to navigate that path, identify alternative paths and the consequences of following them.
6. The evaluators will answer the questions/evaluation sheet at each step made towards the goal state. Actions and choices should be determined based on the number of potential users anticipated to have problems.
7. The recorder will note any significant points, uncertainties raised while the moderator should maintain focus on the walkthrough, resolving issues as they arrive.
8. As actions are identified, the presenter will execute that action and the system response should be identified.

__Notes:__

* Steps 1-4 can occur in an introductory meeting in advance.
* Remember to allow the recorder plenty of time to take their notes properly
* The JogThrough tends to be more informal and relaxed allowing for discussion of alternative approaches and problem areas, and often makes use of electronic recording apparatus, or logging/screen recording tools to facilitate note taking.
* The Walkthrough tends to be more formalised and rigorous requiring much more time and attention to detail.
* Feel free to find a happy medium between the two which works in your context of use.


#### Result Interpretation

Gather the evaluation sheets and comments made during the evaluation session and relate them to the screens. Prepare a short report of recommendations based on the comments, often refining any task analysis and scenarios previously prepared will clearly highlight the difference and the impact it will have.

Be careful with the results. While a comment or critique about a particular item in a task step can be valid, it is important to consider the bigger picture. That item may be important to another task sequence or in a different context of use.

#### Do’s and Don’t’s

* DON’T get defensive about the design.
* DO make clear the ground rules for the walkthrough
* DON’T design in the walkthrough. Try to quickly suggest alternative text or concepts but don’t go into too much detail
* DON’T argue theory or practice. Keep it focused on the current design not what it should be.
* DO have a usability specialist present. In fact make the usability specialist the leader
* DO start with a simple task and advance to complex tasks
* DO use realistic tasks that will be typically encountered. Walkthoughs take a lot of time – try to cover the most used functionality unless you’ve a good reason not to.
* DO choose your tasks carefully! Think about duplication, overlap, variations, complexity.
* DO provide cues and aids. Give everyone a copy of the evaluation sheet. Show them the Four Questions. Put them on a white board in big bold type.
* DON’T ignore the Recorder. Make sure they have enough time to note take if they’re manually recording everything. Make things easy for them – give them a Dictaphone, tape recorder or video camera if they are available.
* DON’T have too many or too few people involved. Too many people could mean the moderator gets swamped trying to control chit_chat or irrelevant discussion. Too few could mean the required variety and experience isn’t present. Try and make sure the right people are there: designer, developer, marketing, typical user. Try and strike a good balance.
* DON’T let the session run on and on. People are busy and won’t participate in future. If it’s taking that long, people are likely to get bored and not give as good feedback too. Try to break up the selected tasks better.

#### Walkthrough Evaluation Sheet

Taken from “The Cognitive Jogthrough: A Fast Paced User Evaluation Procedure” (1992)

Actions/choices should be ranked according to what percentage of potential users are expected to have problems: O= none; 1 = some; 2 = more than half; 3 = most.

1. Description of user’s immediate goal:
2. (First/next) atomic action user should take:
   1. Obvious that action is available? Why/Why not?
   1. Obvious that action is appropriate to goal’? Why/Why not?
3. All other available actions /ess appropriate? For each, why/why not?
4. How will the user execute the action?
   1. Problems? Why/Why not?
5. Execute the action. Describe system response:
   1. Obvious progress has been made toward goal? Why/Why not?
   1. User can access needed information in system response? Why/Why not?
6. Describe appropriate modified goal, if any:
   1. Obvious that goal should change? Why/Why not?
   1. If task completed, is it obvious? Why/Why not?
