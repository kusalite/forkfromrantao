# Course Policies

### Prerequisites

Students are expected to have taken ‘Designing for the Internet of Things’ or can demonstrate relevant prior coursework or experiences to prepare them for this. 

### Instructional Methods
Classes will involve lectures, labs, hands-on tutorials, discussions, critique sessions and workshops. Students will participate in and lead class discussion/presentations.

### Grading

To facilitate marking all students are expected to prepare project pages on the course GitHub Repo which documents the assigned projects and where regular assignments are posted. All work must be submitted or presented by the deadline. Late work will not be accepted. 
		 	 	 		
### Grading Policy

Final grades for the course will be broken down as follows:
- Attendance & Participation - 10%
- Planning Documents (specification + BoM) - 10%
- 3 x Code Reviews (5% each) - 15%
- Contributed Tutorial / Research Talk - 15%
- Final Outcome - 50% (10% awarded at each milestone, 20% for final milestone) 

Creative Project Grading (including Final Project)
- 40% - Merit of the creative outcome
- 30% - Description of process (ideation, iteration, etc.)
- 30% - Documentation of the outcome (code, video, circuit diagrams, repeatability, etc.)

### Grading Standards / Rubric 

- A: Superlative or exemplary work, initiative beyond the description of the problem. Significant understanding of the problem. Conceptual clarity. An attitude of self-motivated exploration, open-mindedness, and a willingness to benefit from criticism.
- B: Very good, some exemplary work, a thorough understanding of the problem. Project displays conceptual foundation, well crafted. Competence and mastery of skills. Open, inquisitive attitude.
- C: Satisfactory or adequate work that meets the minimum requirements of the problem and course. Shows understanding of the problem, with some deficiencies. Reasonable mastery of skill and concepts. This grade is seen to represent the average solution.
- D: Passing, work that is complete, but does not show an understanding of the problem or expectations, and demonstrates deficient skills. 
- R: Failing work that does not meet the requirements of the studio, shows a serious deficiency in skills or is incomplete. 

### Grading Scale

The grading scale for the course is as follows:
- A - 90 - 100%
- B - 80 - 90%
- C - 70 - 80%
- D - 60 - 70%
- R - < 60%  		

### Process Documentation
Students are expected to maintain good documentation of their work process throughout the course. It is recommended that all students should maintain a journal (notebook, blog, etc) and regularly photograph (or video) their creative work as it is being prepared. Students will be asked to share this documentation with the instructor as part of regular assignments and graded outcomes.  

Students will also be asked to use GitHub to track and share their on-going work with other students. A private GitHub repo will be created and all students will use it. Each student will have a subfolder and should fork and sync the repo regularly. Design materials, prototype collateral and other work in progress should be collated here (code, circuit diagrams, etc.) Updates should be made as 
Hardware and Software
We will cover a diverse array of software and hardware relevant to the Internet of Things. While preferred hardware and software will be introduced during the labs and tutorials, students are free to use any software or hardware they wish to complete assignments.  Students may use Eagle, Fritzing, Rhino, Grasshopper, Solidworks, Arduino, Python (for rPi), Processing, Pure Data, openframeworks + ofxiOS, iOS SDK, etc.. 

### Required Texts
There are no required texts for this class. Regular readings not be assigned. Optional readings will be provided from time to time. Digital and photocopied reading/viewing material will be provided by the instructor and available on the course webpage.
Facilities and Lab Use
The course will use the IDeATe Physical Computing Studio in Hunt Library. Students are required to comply with the policies and procedures for the IDeaTe facilities (see: [http://ideate.andrew.cmu.edu/category/policy-proc/](http://ideate.andrew.cmu.edu/category/policy-proc/)) 

The studio provides some short term lending of parts and consumable electronic components for use in student projects. These are available for reasonable use only and should not be abused. Additional and advanced hardware and components may be accessed in the Physical Computing Studio and in the IDeATe equipment lending pool which is open 7 days a week in the basement of Hunt Library. Required hardware (laptops, cameras, peripherals) may be checked out on request. If equipment is out of stock or new general purpose equipment is needed, email [help@ideate.cmu.edu](mailto:help@ideate.cmu.edu) to make a request. 

For some of the assignments, students maybe be required to use specific equipment, hardware or software. Not all required equipment may be available but it will be the responsibility of the student to purchase it (see below). 

### Course Fee
There is __no fee for this course__.  Students will be expected to __cover their project costs individually__.

### Data Loss

Students are responsible for their own work. Work lost to due computer error, portable media error, or personal error is the responsibility of the student and will not be an excuse for late or missing work. At the end of the semester all students may be required to submit all work incl. source code, process documentation, etc.. Do not discard original files of any assignment and the use of github or other source management solutions is recommended.

### Attendance
Students are expected to attend all classes. During class times, students are expected to give their full attention to the class materials, discussions and seminars. Students found to be consulting non-class related material, using their mobile phone or engaged in social networking will be immediately deemed absent.

If you need to miss a class for any reason, inform the instructor before the class if possible, and/or after the missed class. More than one unexcused absence will adversely affect your effort grade (see section on grading). In no case can a student expect to receive a passing grade without regular attendance and participation in class. 

### Absences 

Students must notify faculty in advance of planned absence for religious holiday or school-related event (i.e. varsity sports trip). If you have an unplanned absence for medical or personal reasons, let the faculty know of your situation as soon as possible. In case of an extended absence for medical or personal reasons, contact the Senior Academic Advisor by mail, e-mail or phone, who will notify the appropriate faculty. Faculty reserve the right to request a formal document verifying a medical excuse.

### Academic Integrity 

Academic Integrity is expected at all time. Carnegie Mellon has a established as well-defined policy on this subject which can be found at: [http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm)

It is the responsibility of the student to verse themselves with these policies. All necessary and appropriate sanctions will be issued to all parties involved with plagiarizing any and all course work. Plagiarism and any other form of academic dishonesty that is in violation with these policies will not be tolerated.
