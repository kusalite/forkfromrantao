# Deliverables

The course is organized around four main sprints, where students will iteratively deliver an improved prototype. 

- Sprint 1: Minimum Viable Product - Due Monday April 3rd
- Sprint 2: Adding Intelligence - Due Monday April 17th
- Sprint 3: Connectivity - Due Monday May 1st
- Sprint 4: Final Push - Due Friday May 12th

As part of each Sprint (agile iterative development cycle), students will

1. Decide what features they will implement and update their student page to reflect this.
2. Conduct one [research exercise](research-exercise.md) in each cycle
3. Participate in a [code review](code-reviews.md) at the end of each cycle where they will examine the code of a peer and make comments and suggestions for refinement

In addition to the above, students are also expected to complete: 

- One **[Technical Tutorial](../tutorials/README.md)**.

All assignment submissions will take the form of pull requests on Github (see: [Submitting Your Work](submitting-work.md) ) 

## Sprint 1: Minimum Viable Product

Prepare an initial working prototype of a product. 

#### Sprint 1 [Research](research-exercise.md#1-experience-and-behavior)

Prepare a mood board, conduct behavior research and develop experience map (states of the device)

#### Sprint 1 Prototype

Develop a first cut implementation of your prototype prototype that explores the interaction and experience with users. 

#### Sprint 1 [Code Review](code-reviews.md)

Review a partners code. Code review pairs will be posted on Slack. These must be completed within 48 hours. 

## Sprint 2: Adding Intelligence

Work to implement complex sensing into the system design.

#### [Sprint 2 Research](research-exercise.md#2-algorithm-and-analysis)

Review and identify suitable algorithms and sensor solutions for your product, to include smoothing, machine learning, predictive, analytics, etc. 

#### Sprint 2 Prototype

As part of this sprint focus on adding and enhancing the sensing and analytics capabilities of your product prototype. 

#### Sprint 2 [Code Review](code-reviews.md)

Review a partners code. Code review pairs will be posted on Slack. These must be completed within 48 hours. 

## Sprint 3: Connectivity

Explore connecting to other things, online platforms and services that provide utility to their platform, storing and analysing sensor data through 3rd party platforms. 

#### Sprint 3 [Research](research-exercise.md#3-api-and-networks)

Research and plan your network communications and the API for your interactive connected product

#### Sprint 3 Prototype

Add in network communications, connectivity to data, services and mobile/web applications.

#### Sprint 3 [Code Review](code-reviews.md)

Review a partners code. Code review pairs will be posted on Slack. These must be completed within 48 hours. 

## Sprint 4: Final Push

You've got an iterated version of their product and it's well implemented. Focus groups will be used to pitch, test and observe their products in use. Students will report on findings, etc. Students will also consider opportunities to optimise their code as a market ready solution. In addition to iterating based on feedback and refining the concept, students will explore how to move their product from prototype to real-world design. 

#### Sprint 4 [Research](research-exercise.md#4-user-testing)

Conduct a [rapid evaluation of your prototype](research-exercise.md#4-user-testing) to gain insight into the final tweaks and enhancements you need to include. 

#### Sprint 4 Prototype

Iterate, refine and fine-tune your product prototype to deliver something polished, robust and ready to showcase. 

## Final Outcomes

###  Presentations / Demo Session 

The format for the event will be part 'trade show' and part rapid fire demo session. 

You'll have __1 minute__ to quickly present your prototype and 4 minutes for questions/comments i.e. [Demo or Die](http://labs.openviewpartners.com/the-origin-of-demo-or-die-and-retrospection-via-sprint-review/): _“One of the most important things that we need to do is demonstrate actually working software in a way that the people who would use that would really experience it.”_ 

That means you should lead by walking through and demonstrating your prototype and not by talking about it. No slides. No videos.  Focus on clearly explaining the idea by showing us how it works. And don't wait for ages to show us how it works. Start with that. 

What you'll need to prepare:

1. A really short succient elevator pitch or at the very least a one sentence explaination of what it is and why we should care about it
2. A well planned demonstration. The demo should tell a story, not just show features. Carefully plan and rehearse how you step through the features and functionality. Make sure you know the breaking points and can avoid them. 
3. A trade show sized poster (24x36”) for your product. See examples below. 

Don't forget to provide opportunities or invitations for guests to try for themselves!

You're also encouraged to have supporting materials to showcase your idea on hand. For example, you might want to have a product video showing example scenarios or unimplemented features, a sample product packaging design / box, a mock up of an app or website, or similar things. These aren't required though. Mainly use additional materials to better showcase your idea, the connected ecosystem it creates and what might be possible if fully implemented.

### Final Documentation

As part of the final deliverables for the class you are also asked to hand in written documentation of your prototype. This should cover the problem space, background review (precedent projects, related resources, inspirations, etc.), the goals of your project, it's technical implementation, its mechanical and physical design, connectivity, periperal applications, etc. This should be well illustrated with images of the prototype, flowcharts describing functionality, circuit diagrams, and code (or pseudocode). 

The format of the documentation should make sense for the broader goals of the project.

1. If you are pursing a product you would like to commercialise, you should write a word document that is closer to a provisional patent and explains the unique aspects of your product concept and the way it's been implemented. See [this](https://wiki.ece.cmu.edu/ddl/index.php/Patent#Disclosure_and_Provisional_Patents) and [this](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-write-a-good-provisional-patent-application)

1. If you are interested in making open source software/hardware and having others be able to create their own DIY implementation, the final documentation should be closer to an [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com). In this case it should give clear step-by-step guidance to build it for yourself.

1. __[Expected Case]__ In all other cases, you should create a web-based documentation (on your student GitHub site) that draws on styles and formats like Kickstarter. For this, you’ll need: a good concept video, some good illustrations or sketches of the idea, a clear description of the concept and considerations and how it would be built/made into a real product (tools, technologies, timeline, potential pain points, and next steps). It would also be helpful to include a video, animation or diagrams of the product. Some examples: [Matrix](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2061039712/matrix-the-internet-of-things-for-everyonetm/description), [Nomiku](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nomiku/new-nomiku-sous-vide-wifi-connected-and-made-in-th/description), [Electric Objects](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/electricobjects/electric-objects-a-computer-made-for-art/description), [Ring](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1761670738/ring-shortcut-everything/description), [NeoLucida](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/neolucida/neolucida-a-portable-camera-lucida-for-the-21st-ce/description), [GifPop](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sha/gifpop-custom-gif-cards-for-everyone/description), [BetaBook](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/betabook/betabook-the-portable-whiteboard-for-the-digital-a/description), [Sense](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hello/sense-know-more-sleep-better/description), etc...
