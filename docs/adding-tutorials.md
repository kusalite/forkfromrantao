# Adding a Tutorial

A full list of tutorials can be found in the [tutorials/](../tutorials/) folder.

-----

__tl;dr; Each person will contribute one brief technical tutorial. It can be anything that's relevant to the class and should match your interest and ability. You prepare one tutorial, once in the semester and share it with the class online and in a short talk in class.__


### Why a tutorial?

It's a way to help develop expertise, reflect on what you've learned as part of your explorations with the IoT, and to contribute something useful back to the class as a whole.

### How it works

Once during the semester, each person will be asked to prepare, publish and present a technical tutorial. The goal of the tutorial should be to introduce a tool, technique, component, library, service etc. that will help other students with their projects. The tutorial should 

You'll publish the tutorial on this site __and__ give a short presentation in class. This will happen at two points in the semester (see the [tutorials](../tutorials/README.md) list for your assignment). 

You can choose what tutorial you'd like to prepare or work with the instructor to find a a suitable topic. Tutorials should be proposed before the deadline to a) take your interests and abilities and b) needs and suitability for the course into consideration.

Not every tutorial will require the same level of effort. More advanced students will be expected to produce more complex or involved tutorials, and may be expected to create custom code or solutions to contribute with the tutorial. In other cases, it may be as simple as recording a screencast and writing some clear instructions. Again, this will be negotiated with the instructor. 

### Example Tutorials Topics 

A good place to start your tutorial from is:

1. to think about something that was technically challenging for you or others in the previous Mini 
2. to focus on something that you want to work with in this course for your project, that will require some noodling out and that you want to invest some time in.
3. to find something that you learned as part of the projects last module but wasn't included in the covered tutorials. 

Your tutorial could be about: 

- Working with an advanced component or sensor e.g. a gyroscope, a camera, a pulse sensor, a pump, etc.
- A useful technique e.g. sending sound between two Particles with a electet mic and a speaker; how to analyse some data in real time; connecting to Processing/desktop app through Serial; working with OSC data, etc.
- Installing and using an interesting Library e.g. working with spark_websockets.
- Connecting to a third party service e.g. Wit.ai, Wolfram Data Drop, etc. 
- Preparing Web, Mobile or Desktop things to communicate/connect with IoT solutions. 
- ... and lots more.

### Publishing your tutorial

Create your tutorial as a new .md in your forked copy of this repo. 

Then, issue a pull request for your tutorial when it's ready. 

### Writing your Tutorial 

Your tutorial can take a few different formats - it could contain a video, have some code samples, include images, and/or a written description. 

While the format may vary, the goal is to write a succient, clear and easy-to-follow guide of how to get something working for your Particle board / an IoT product. 

The tutorial should be reasonably brief (around 1-2 pages), sensibly illustrated with images and video and be written with the class in mind. Basically, how would you introduce this thing quickly to the person sitting next to you? 

As part of your tutorial you will probably need to:

- Take photos of circuits and videos of working outcomes
- Create circuit diagrams in [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org)
- Clearly list any libraries used or dependencies involved. 
- Create sketches or diagrams for technical concepts
- Create and include code samples for Particle
- Link to other online tutorials, guides, datasheets, or articles that provide more detail

### Thinks to think about

- Who created it? Don't forget to put your name and date at the top of the tutorial. 
- Your iPhone is your best resource. Capture photo, video and GIF's as you go. 
- If you need to shoot video, you can borrow a DSLR camera and tripod from the IDeATe Lending Desk. There's also more available at the Hunt Library main lending desk. Don't forget to find a clean background to film against (this goes for tables and other surfaces.) If you want to go all out some lighting equipment is available in Hunt too. 
- There are document cameras in the Institute and in the Physical Computing lab. With a little effort you can record really nice overhead video from these. 
- Make sure you credit and attribute any media (videos, photos) that you embed. This should include the name of the original creator, the license for the media (creative commons) and a link to the original source or site.
