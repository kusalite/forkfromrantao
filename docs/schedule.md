# Course Schedule


The course will be organized as a series of 2-week sprints on technical areas. Students will be expected to focus on technical depth and prepare well-considered and planned iterations with each cycle. 

## Sprint 1: Minimum Viable Product

#### Week 1: Pitch 
Students will give a pitch of their initial concept and be asked to define the features and development milestones as part of a functional specification. Student will receive feedback on initial concepts and suggested technical implementation. By the end of week one, students will have an initial bill of materials and work-plan prepared for their product.

__Tuesday March 21st__ 

- Introduction to the course
- Discussion on project proposals
		
__Thursday, March 23rd__

- Tutorial: Using GitHub
- Tutorial: Review of code and development practices
- Review: Proposals (each person present for 2 mins)

__Assignments__

- [Proposals](project-proposals.md) - Due Thursday for Class 
- [Functional Spec + Bill of Materials](project-spec.md) - due Monday night 9pm

#### Week 2: Basic Prototype
Students will prepare an initial working prototype of their product. Critique and feedback will focus on the behavior, state, experience, workflows and components to be used.

## Sprint 3: Connectivity

#### Week 5: Online Connectivity

Students will explore connecting to other things, online platforms and services that provide utility to their platform, storing and analysing sensor data through 3rd party platforms. In addition students will design the data and network interactions of their device, and prepare a draft API that describes how other systems might interact with it. 

__Tuesday April 18th__

## Sprint 4: Final Push

#### Week 7: Testing + Scaling

Students will finalize their plans for what it will do, how and why? At this point, students should have a well-refined and iterated version of their product developed. Focus groups will be used during class time to pitch, test and observe their products in use. Students will report on findings, etc. Students will also consider opportunities to optimise their code as a market ready solution. In addition to iterating based on feedback and refining the concept, students will explore how to move their product from prototype to real-world design.
