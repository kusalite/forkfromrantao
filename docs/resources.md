### Development Process

- 37 Signal's [Getting Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php#ch11)  - a great primer on building lean software and developing with agile methods

- [Prototype to Production](http://www.proto2prod.com), Blog by Particle dealing with aspects of building real hardware products.


### Development

##### Audio

- [Playing Sounds from Particle](https://community.particle.io/t/playing-sounds-from-spark-core/4005)

##### Useful Functions

- [Arduino Code Lib](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CodeLib) is a good starting point but many examples need to be mildy adapted to Particle
- [Arduino Sketch Library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/FunctionLibrary&arubalp=51fee146-1fa9-4ba8-9a2a-ddbb76bced) contains more useful examples
