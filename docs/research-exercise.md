# Research Exercises

During each of the three sprints students will be asked to conduct a short research exercise which will help them deepen and develop their technical approach.

## 1. Experience and Behavior

Identify a handful of comparable product experiences. These should be inspirational resources of the interactivity or design you would like to achieve with your device. 

Create a 'mood board' which explores their interactive behavior. Pay attention to how they: present information to users; animations used; use of light and color as an indicator; functions, arrangement, and placement of buttons; when and how they notify users of required actions; etc. Pay attention to edge cases - how do they signal errors, complications or when action is needed. How do they gracefully handle failure, transition between states, etc.

Dissect one aspect of this interactive behavior that you feel would be particular useful to integrate and create a compelling product expeirence for an end user. Explore, detail and document how you might implement this interactive behavior in your project (use code!)

Note: the focus here is on the device itself (and not peripheral or mobile experiences).

## 2. Algorithm and Analysis

Based on the sensors and behavior you imagine for your device, research one algorithm, approach or method that will help you work with, analyze or leverage data in your product. This could include machine learning techniques, sensor fusion, data analysis methods, bayesian inference/prediction, etc. 

Report on the analysis technique you have explored, describe it's relevance and applicability to your project and outline how you would employ it within your product. 

## 3. API and Networks

An API is a structured way to access and manipulate data on the Internet. The Particle cloud builds an API in for free, and this is what allows all those 'things' on the internet to talk to your Photon. As part of this exercise, you'll structure that conversation. 

To learn more about API's and designing them, [start with this article](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api) and then [this one](https://codeplanet.io/principles-good-restful-api-design/)

The simple goal of this exercise is to research, plan and consider the other devices you might like to allow access to your products data and consider how that happens. You'll think about the information passed between your devices, when that happens and what occurs when it does. 

When this research is finished you should:

1. Have developed an API description like: https://stripe.com/docs/api#charges
2. Diagram the way in which information is passed between devices. 

## 4. User Testing

In Sprint 4, you should be close to a final product. This is the perfect time to try it with users and get a fresh pair of eyes on your product. 

Find 2-3 people and do one of the following

1. Run a [heuristic evaluation](heuristic-evaluation.md) with real users
2. Run a [Cognitive Jogthrough](cognitive-jogthrough.md) with assumed users 
3. Run a 'playtest' or focus group where you allow users to explore and give feedback on the product. 

Report on your findings and refine your product backlog for this Sprint to address needed/suggested changes.
