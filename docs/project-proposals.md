# Project Proposals

__tl;dr; 1 page proposal due for the idea you'd like to work on for the rest of the semester. It should be a reasonably ambitious project with lots of opportunity for follow-on.__


As part of this course, you're asked to self select an idea for an IoT product that you're excited to make real. The course is set up as an opportunity to solve a problem you care about through the IoT, to discover or realize a passion project or to build an idea you want to take to market or out into the world. This gives you a lot of opportunity to build a great project for your portfolio, to get companies you want a job with excited about you, and to help develop your software skills through something you definitely give a damn about! 

## The proposal

The proposal can be any format you like. It should be at least 200 words describing the idea, why you want to build it and what it would do with a maximum of 500 words (approx 1 page). Feel free to sprinkle in some images, links to relevant related projects or designs which have inspired your approach. 

The proposal itself should be posted to your [student](../students/README.md) page (either inline or as a link to a sub-page that you create).

## Choosing a project 

Students will be asked to self-select their focus of exploration within this course. As part of the first week, students must submit a 1-page proposal for their work in this elective. Students can propose any project they would like to work on, so long as it is not the subject of active exploration in another class. Students may, for example, identify a project from the ‘Designing for Internet of Things’ course or a personal project they would like to develop further. Students may propose to work collaboratively __(no more than teams of 2)__ or independently on their chosen topic. Students can also opt to work on assigned or research problems and should contact the instructor to discuss in this circumstance. 

## What can/should I work on?

The possibilities are far and wide. The main thing is to choose something you care about. Having a project that's genuinely interesting to you is going to make it much easier to invest the time and craft it into a fully fledged reasonably feature-complete thing over the next 7 weeks. This should be your first concern. From there there's lots of options.

1. __Build out an idea from the previous course:__ Was there a project you worked on (individually or collaboratively) that you really liked the idea of? Maybe you'd like to revisit the [ambient financial devices](http://daraghbyrne.github.io/diot2016/assignments/creative-assignment-2/), explore [connected intimacy](http://daraghbyrne.github.io/diot2016/assignments/creative-assignment-3/) again or continue one of the [fitness prototypes for the connected gym](http://daraghbyrne.github.io/diot2016/assignments/final-assignment/). This is all fair game!

2. __Open source an existing project__ Is there a awesome connected product that you love? Why not try and DIY it. This would make a great way to focus on learning new technical skills without having to worry too much about designing the experience, functionality or features - you'd just replicate. And after all, [great artists steal](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/). For example:
   - Zach Supalla, CEO of Particle, built an [open-source Nest-alike thermostat](https://www.hackster.io/zsup/open-source-nest-alike-learning-thermostat-f67b82) to demonstrate the potential of the Particle framework 
   - Daniel Nordness uses the Particle to build a [wifi controlled outlet](https://www.hackster.io/daniel0524/building-a-wifi-outlet-cf3d0c), like the [Belkin Wemo Switch](http://www.belkin.com/us/F7C029/p/P-F7C029/?_ga=1.233682776.791341021.1458186323)
   - There's loads of examples of people making [Hue-alikes](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/) with Arduino and Particle
   - You could easily replicate [Lockitron] because they've made the [mechanical assembly](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13648) available to buy on Sparkfun. Why not make a smart door without the hassle of having to design the assembly? 
  - Take a look at the [IoTList](http://iotlist.co) and find something awesome to build

3. __Make Something strange/left-of-center/weird.__ 

	- [The Firefly communicator](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/921195236/firefly-communicator-listen-to-nature-speak-firefl?ref=thanks_tweet) is an interactive device that let's you attract fireflies by mimicing their own light patterns
	- [Constellaction](http://www.creativeapplications.net/arduino-2/constellaction-intricate-emergent-behaviour-using-autonomous-building-blocks/) is a series of interactive objects that talk to one another with light to create building blocks for emergent behavior.
	
	- [Pinokio](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/pinokio-the-animatronic-lamp-that-is-aware-of-its-environment/) is a different kind of smart lamp. It's an animatronic lamp that's aware of it's surroundings and can move like the Pixar logo to interact with people in lovely ways. 

	- You could create a scent dispenser for social media like [Olly](http://www.ollyfactory.com) or candy dispenser that rewards you for every like like [Polly](http://www.ollyfactory.com/polly/).

	- Have a look at [Berg London's past projects](http://berglondon.com/projects/) for some inspiration 

	- Or visit this Tumblr for some strange inspiration - [http://theinternetofuselessthings.com](http://theinternetofuselessthings.com)

4. __Make something that solves a problem you care about__ 


	* [BuggyAir](http://superflux.in/work/buggyair&arubalp=b0503a2b-3c67-4e52-962b-02732f0f7d) is an accurate mobile sensing kit that helps parents understand their children's exposure to air pollution. Built with Arduino by Superflux

	* [SmartCitizen](https://smartcitizen.me/) is an open source sensing platforms designed for researchers, schools, citizen science, communities, cities and developers to participate in their cities through envirnmental sensing and urban monitoring

	* [TomorrowLab’s DIY traffic counter](http://tomorrow-lab.com/lab16) is a low-cost, open-source measurement device that allows anyone to accurately measure and visualize street traffic counts. Their [HI-VIZ Bike Counter ](http://tomorrow-lab.com/lab27) is designed to bring attention to the number of bicylists in urban spaces. 

    * Or you could save bikers from injury by helping to create an automatic [Pot Hole Logger](http://hackaday.com/2012/11/23/arduino-data-logger-maps-out-the-potholes-on-your-morning-commute/)

5. __Make something you'd want to buy__ Simple as that, what would you buy as a product if it was avilable tomorrow? What do you think you could make money from? Is there an idea for a product, device or interactive thing that's been in the back of your mind for a while? Now's the time to make it.
