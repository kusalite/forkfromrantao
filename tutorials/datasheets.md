# Reading a Datasheet

You’ve probably already looked on Adafruit and Sparkfun for components. And in those product listings you’ll find a datasheet. The datasheet is the manufacturer’s guide to designers like you on how to use and work with a sensor, motor, or anything else.

It’ll include all kinds of useful information like how the terminals (pins) are arranged and why, how you control or read data from it, the sensitivity of sensors and their tolerances, and their power requirements too. 

**_But datasheets are hard to read - especially if you haven’t done it before. _**They’re overwhelming, dense, poorly diagramed, full of jargon, contain pages of technical information, and all you want is to know if it’s good to use with your Photon and does what you need for your circuit. 

The trick to understanding a datasheet, is to only focus on the stuff in there you really care about. *Skim - don’t read*. For the most part you just want to know: 

* The description - what the component is and does

* The pin diagram - how it’s wired and how you connect it to your circuit

* The electrical characteristics - how many Volts does it need and what’s the max it can take and how it operates. 

Sparkfun has a great guide which breaks down the datasheet. I’d recommend [reading it](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/223), but: **90% of the datasheet is irrelevant and it’s good to know this upfront. **

Take a look at the TMP36 on Sparkfun and try out the datasheet: [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10988](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10988)  Can you make sense of it? 

## Tips and Tricks:

* *You don’t need to read it all!* Don’t feel like you need to! 

* *Skim to the sections* that seem like they might be useful to your project. 

* *Power* is the most important thing you’ll need to know: Will your motor drive with 3.3v power or do you need more? Will you sensor work with 3.3v too?

* Figure out what the crucial things you need to know before you pop open the datasheet. 

* *Check for notes at the end* - this will tell you anything special you’ll need to pay attention to;

* Better yet. *Search **[forum*s](http://community.particle.io)* or **[guide*s](https://learn.sparkfun.com)* **[onlin*e](http://learn.adafruit.com). If you only need to know how to wire it, someone will have done this before. You won’t need the datasheet for this, just google!
