Office Hours: Byrne: Friday, 3pm-4.20pm HL-A10; Paetz: Monday, 15.30-17.30, PhysComp Hunt, A10 <br/>
TA: [Joseph Paetz](rpaetz@andrew.cmu.edu) <br/>


> Building on ‘Designing for the Internet of Things’, this elective will give students the opportunity to explore the development of a single internet of things concept in greater depth. To get access to this course, students must first propose a project they would like to focus their seven week exploration on. Over the next seven weeks, students will iterate through the development lifecycle of a single project with a focus on technical rigor, depth and robustness. Students will develop their competency with microcontroller programming and learn methods for sensing, transmission, storage, analysis, communication, connectivity and presentation of data in IoT scenarios.  Students will be supported in this exploration by weekly guest talks from industry leaders who will provide their insights on developing and bringing to market robust IoT products. Finally, students will engage in weekly critique and work sessions where they can seek instructor support in transforming their concept into tangible world-ready product. By the end of the course, students will have realized a refined prototype which is near-market ready. 

__*tl;dr:* It's a hands-on IoT course focused on developing one product prototype in-depth over 7-weeks. It aims to advancing individual skills in IoT software and hardware development and actualize your passion project into a near-market-ready prototype.__

### Learning Objectives

This is an interdiscipinary course designed for those new to IoT prototyping and development. It builds on the 'Designing for the Internet of Things' mini-3 course but helps you do a deep dive into software development. In particular it focuses on building your personal skill with software and hardware development as well as _the development processes_ to follow when building IoT solutions.  It’s about advancing individual skills, developing passion projects, and bringing ideas to market or making ideas patentable. In this course, we will: 

- Explore agile development processes to rapidly and iteratively prepare an IoT 'minimum viable product';
- Focus on developing individual software developing skills and familiarity with software development through the Arduino language;
- Examine advanced techniques and best practice for sensing, transmission, storage, analysis, presentation and communication of data for IoT solutions;
- Understand these techniques by applying them in a IoT prototype and work towards a feature complete, robust and optimised prototype. 

__By the end of the course, students should be able to:__

- Have applied experience of the key concepts for sensing, transmission, storage, analysis, presentation and communication of data for IoT solutions.
- Be able to follow an agile developement process to: generate systems specifications from a perceived need, design APIs and network communications for IoT solutions and plan and manage a timeline for implementing a single feature complete prototype.
- Be able to independently review and recognize means to improve code.
- Be able to work independently to prepare a fully functional prototype of a system.

### Outcomes

By the end of the course, students should have the following outcomes:

- a robust real world prototype that will be nearly ready for market
- a clear set of materials and documents to present their idea for potential funding, investment and global feedback
- advancement and preparedness of student to prepare innovative IoT solutions in agile, iterative explorations as might occur in lean-startup style workplaces.

### Sprints

This course takes an agile approach building on the scrum framework for software development. For each, sprint:

- The student will creates a prioritized wish list called a 'product backlog'.
- During sprint planning, you'll pull a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decide how to implement those pieces.
- The team has a certain amount of time — a sprint (in this case 2 weeks) — to complete its work
- At the end of the sprint, the work should be 'potentially' shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.
- The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
- As the next sprint begins, you choose another chunk of the product backlog and being working again.
